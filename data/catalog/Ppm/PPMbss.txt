-          Summary
           =======
0          A number of bright stars is missing from the PPM Star Catalogue,
           both on the northern and on the southern hemisphere.  The Bright
           Stars Supplement described here makes PPM complete down to V=7.5
           mag. For this purpose it lists all missing stars brighter than
           V=7.6 mag that we could find in published star lists.  Their
           total number is 275.  Only 2 of them are brighter than V=3.5
0          This replaces the December 1992 edition of the Bright Stars
           Supplement which inadvertantly contained 46 duplicates of stars
           already contained in the main parts of PPM.

           1. Scope of the Bright Stars Supplement
           =======================================
0          There are roughly 20 000 stars brighter than V=7.6 mag on the
           whole sky.  About 210 of these are missing in the northern part
           of PPM (+90 to -2.5 degrees declination), and about 65 are
           missing in the southern part (-2.5 to -90 degrees).  This is not
           a problem for the main purpose of PPM, viz. to provide a dense
           and accurate practical coordinate system on the sky. It may be
           disturbing, however, if e.g. finder charts are to be drawn or if
           bright stars are to be used for a rough orientation of
           photographic plates.
0          The Bright Stars Supplement was produced to eliminate this
           problem. It simply lists those bright stars which have no
           counterpart in PPM (both north and south).  It is available in
           machine-readable and in printed form, the latter being included
           in Volume III of the printed PPM.  If merged with its Bright
           Stars Supplement, PPM is complete to V=7.5.

-
           2. Construction and properties of the Supplement
           ================================================
0          We collected all stars brighter than V=7.6 from a variety of
           published star lists, most notably the Bright Star Catalogue, the
           TYCHO Input Catalogue, the HIPPARCOS Input Catalogue, and the
           General Catalogue (via its inclusion in the SAO Catalogue).
           Astrometric data and information on duplicity were collected from
           the most appropriate source in each case. The magnitudes were
           mostly taken from the Hipparcos Input Catalogue.
0          From the resulting provisional star list (roughly 20 000 objects)
           we selected those which have no PPM counterpart within a distance
           of 10 arcsec in both right ascension and declination.
0          In addition we checked all stars in the provisional star list
           that had only faint PPM counterparts within the 10 arcsec
           coordinate interval.  This procedure added just 2 stars. Both are
           the bright components of close double stars, of which only the
           fainter component is in PPM.  The resulting Supplement contains
           275 objects.  Only two of them are brighter than V=3.5.
0          It should be clear to users that the Supplement does not give
           astrometric data with the same quality as the main parts of PPM.
           The Supplement contains exactly those stars for which no good
           astrometric data could be derived in the construction of PPM.
           Either they are double stars unmeasurable for the usual
           astrometric instruments, or the existing measurements are grossly
           discordant, or else there are no precise measurements at all in
           the position catalogues. More than 70 percent of all stars in the
1
                                                                      Page 3
-
           Supplement are flagged as double. For the 45 stars brighter than
           V=6 the percentage is almost 100 percent.
0          The Bright Stars Supplement is not intended to be a source of
           high-quality astrometric data for bright double stars, many of
           which are orbital binaries.  Its sole purpose is to provide, for
           every stellar object in the sky that is brighter than about
           V=7.5, a corresponding entry in the combined PPM. Therefore no
           attempt was made to separate the components of close double stars
           (i.e. closer than about 10 arcsec).
0          A user might ask for a completeness limit fainter than the V=7.5
           provided here. On one hand, it would be very hard to get beyond
           7.5. The only published star list claiming to be complete to
           fainter magnitudes is given by the Durchmusterung catalogues. But
           due to their old epoch and low positional accuracy they are quite
           unsuited for the present purpose.  The Guide Star Catalogue is
           known to be incomplete in this magnitude range.
0          On the other hand we convinced ourselves that of the roughly
           20 000 stars between V=7.5 and V=8.5 only a few hundred are
           missing from PPM.  So, the combined PPM can be considered as
           practically complete to at least V=8.5. In photographic
           magnitudes this corresponds to roughly 9 mag.

           3. Explanation of the machine-readable version
           ==============================================
0          The machine-readable version of the Bright Stars Supplement to
           PPM contains 2 physical files. Initially it is distributed by the
           authors on a DOS 3.5 inch diskette. Later on it will probably
           also become available at the astronomical data centers.
0          The Bright Stars Supplement can only be used in conjunction with
           the main parts of PPM. It is, therefore, not necessary to repeat
           the detailed explanation of the catalogue's format and contents.
           Instead we mainly point out the differences to the format and
           contents of the main parts.
-
           File 1: Introduction to the Bright Stars Supplement
+          ___________________________________________________
0          Exactly as the Introductions to PPM and PPM South, but much
           shorter. Record length is 133 bytes, but only 76 bytes are
           actually used (the remaining being always blank).  This file can
           be used to produce printed versions of the introduction on any
           printer able to interpret the paper feed characters '1' (form
           feed), ' ' (single line feed), '0' (double line feed), '-'
           (triple line feed) and '+' (no line feed).

-
-          File 2: The Bright Stars Supplement
+          ___________________________________
0          This is the file giving the catalogue proper. Record length is
           133 bytes. The format is exactly the same as for file 2 of the
           main parts of PPM. The following differences are to be noted:
0          The PPM number of the Supplement stars is a running number,
           starting with 400 001, and ending with 400 321. This numbering
           was chosen to avoid any confusion with other PPM objects.  It
           also ensures that a Supplement PPM number can be easily
           recognized as such. The first version of the Bright Stars
           Supplement contained 321 stars, 46 of which were erroneously
           included.  They are duplicates of stars already contained in the
           main parts of PPM. They are omitted here. Therefore the numbering
           sequence contains some gaps.
0          Cross-identifications and spectral classes were entered by 
           A.R.Peters. The stars were identified by their positions, using
           the SAO and HD catalogues, and in some cases the WDS, GCVS and HIC.
           Almost all spectral classes have been taken from the Henry Draper
           catalogue.
0          The number of source positions is always zero.
0          The flags in bytes 129 to 130 are always blank, a remark is
           indicated by 'R' in byte 131 as usual. Remarks are given for
           entries having two HD or SAO numbers, and for identifications
           that are provisional because the position or magnitudes of the
           reference sources do not fit the BSS data well.
0          The flag in byte 127 (the problem case flag in the main parts of
           PPM) is always 'B' for 'bright star'. It still is to say "do not
           use this object as astrometric reference star". The flag in byte
           128 (the double star flag) has the usual meaning.
0          The right ascensions and the proper motions in right ascension
           are rounded to 0.1 second and 0.1 second per century,
           respectively.
0          The declinations and proper motions in declination are rounded to
           1 arcsec and 1 arcsec per century, respectively.
0          The variance/covariance items for the positions and proper
           motions are set to constant values roughly representative of the
           actual accuracy of the data.

                        The companion to PPM 400148 is PPM 357553, which is

                        preceding SAO star (250695 as listed in the PPM-South).
                        However the PPM-South tabulates a magnitude of 6.0,
                        fitting the secondary star (HD 85124 which is listed in 
                        the PPM-South). The BSS originally had the brighter 
                        magnitude but essentially the same position.
                        This version of the BSS has been updated to conform to
